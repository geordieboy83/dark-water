In the dark waters of a sea near the world's end, two players face off till one is left standing. Somewhere in the sea a volcano continually erupts launching boulders which curiously seem to be directed at any unfortunate ship happening to be nearby. Throughout the sea are scattered five boxes floating on the waters. Some of them are beneficial to the one that collects them, some not so. Lurking in cute gift wrap you may find the ultimate artifact which obliterates whatever it happens to strike (you wouldn't want to miss with this one, nor stand very close to it either!), as well as a Windows user's greatest nightmare: a blue screen of death! As a tribute to my first module coursework, the player might also find themselves transformed into a teapot.
